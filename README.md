# **A Partial Least Squares Calibration Model for Predicting Biogenic Silica in Lake Sediment Cores in High Arctic Settings**

## I. Purpose

The aim of this project is to create a partial least squares (PLS) calibration model to facilitate paleoclimatologists in converting their raw absorbance spectral data into percentages of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Biogenic Silica (BSi) in lake core samples. This project focuses mainly on developing and cross-validating a Partial Least Squares Regression model for lake core samples. Future work encompasses (1) packaging this code in R so paleoclimatologists can tailor the model to their specific needs (2) creating an interactive dashboard where paleoclimatologists can input their raw spectral data, adjust for certain parameters, and collect predicted percentage values.
