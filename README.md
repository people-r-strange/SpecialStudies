# **A Partial Least Squares Calibration Model for Predicting Biogenic Silica**

The aim of this project is to create a partial least squares (PLS) calibration model to facilitate paleoclimatologists in converting their raw absorbance spectral data into percentages of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Biogenic Silica (BSi) in lake core samples.
